# Crypto_Diversity_Pipeline

Pipeline for genome assembly and analysis of data from Desjardins et al. 2017


## Broad description (new version)

Raw Illumina sequencing reads generated by Desjardins et al. 2017 were downloaded from the NIH Sequence Read Archive (BioProject ID PRJNA382844).  For each of the 387 BioSamples (corresponding strains of interest) associated with the BioProject, we created a reference based genome assembly based on aligning paired-end sequence data to the genome of the reference of the corresponding lineage (see below). In cases where there were multiple sequencing runs for a given BioSample, we concatenated the FASTQ files of the multiple runs into one.  

We used the following reference genome assemblies to align the reads of a sample of a given lineage to its corresponding reference:  
* VNI -- H99, [GCA_011801205.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_011801205.1/)  
* VNII -- VNII strain collected from cockatoo excrement , [GCA_022832995.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_022832995.1/)  
* VNBI -- Ftc146-1, [GCA_010065285.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_010065285.1/)
* VNBII -- Bt81, [GCA_023650555.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_023650555.1/)  

To create reference based genome assemblies we aligned reads to the corresponding reference genome using BWA (vXXX; Li and Durbin 2009), called variants using FreeBayes (vXXX; Garrison and Marth 2012), and generated strain-specific consensus assembly by instantiating the called variants onto the corresponding reference genome.  The read alignment, variant calling, and consensus assembly were carried out using the Snippy (https://github.com/tseemann/snippy) pipeline tool.

To have a consistent naming scheme in the annotations we "lifted over" the annotation of the strain H99 (FungiDB R65) to each of the four reference genomes using the software tool Liftoff (vXXX; Shumate and Salzberg 2020). Following construction of consensus assemblies, genome feature annotation was "lifted over" from the corresponding reference genome to each strain-specific genome.  The `-polish` option of Liftoff was employed to re-align exons in cases where the lift-over procedure resulted in start/stop codon loss or introduced an in-frame stop codon.  

Based on the polished lift-over annotation, the AGAT GTF/GFF Toolkit software (https://github.com/NBISweden/AGAT) was used to predict protein sequences for all annotated genes in each strain-specific assembly using the `agat_sp_extract_sequences.pl` script. Where multiple protein isoforms are annotated in the reference genome, we generated predictions for each isoform.

  * `reference_genomes/`[FungiDB-65_CneoformansH99_Genome.fasta](https://fungidb.org/common/downloads/release-65/CneoformansH99/fasta/data/FungiDB-65_CneoformansH99_Genome.fasta) :exclamation: NOTE: Currently using verion of release 53
  * `reference_genomes/`[FungiDB-65_CneoformansH99.gff](https://fungidb.org/common/downloads/release-65/CneoformansH99/gff/data/FungiDB-65_CneoformansH99.gff) :exclamation: NOTE: Currently using verion of release 53


Scripts to be run in this order:

1. `get-sra.xsh` -- given an NCBI BioProject ID, identifies all the BioSamples associated with that project and downloads each into a folder called `Samples/${SRSID}` where `SRSID` are SRA SRS numbers
    * Files produced:
        
      * `{project_id}_samples.txt` -- a tab-delimited text file listing all the samples associated with the BioProject.  Three columns: SAM, Name, SRS  where SAM = BioSample Sample ID , Name = common name, SRS = SRA sequence read identifier
        
      * `{project_id}_SRStoSRR.txt` -- tab-delimited text file giving mapping between SRS (Samples) IDs and SRR (Runs) IDs. A given SRS can have multiple associated SRRs. 
        
      * Each `Samples/${SRSID}` directory will contain a number of SRR subdirectories of the form `Samples/${SRSID}/{SRRID}` where SRA runs are "prefetched" using the SRA Tools `prefetch` command.


2. `get-fastqs.xsh` -- turn each of the "prefetched" run files (produced in the prior step) into FASTQ files, written to `fastqs/` directory

3. `get-read-pair-tables.xsh` -- create CSV files to know which read files are paired and unpaired runs of each sample.
    * Files produced:
    
      * `read_pair_table.csv` -- Columns are SRS ID, SRR ID, read pair 1, read pair 2, total size in bytes of read pair

      * `unpaired_fastqs.csv` -- Columns are SRS ID, SRR ID, fastq file(s)

      * `largest_read_pair_table.csv` -- A filtered version of `read_pair_table.csv`, giving the single largest pair per sample. It uses `scripts/largest_readpair.R`.
    
4. `get-lineage-of-samples.xsh` -- add the SRS codes to the `Desjardins_Supplemental_Table_S1.csv` using `read_pair_table.csv`.  
    * Files produced:
    
      * `sample_metadata.csv`  -- Columns are Strain, Sample, Name, Group, VNI subdivision, Mating type,Country of origin, Isolation source, Broad Project, SRA Accession, Strain description, In GWAS, Phenotyped

5. `get-references.xsh` -- uses `lineage_references.csv` and `sample_metadata.csv` to associate each sample with its reference
   * Files produced:
  
     * `sample_reference.csv` -- Columns are lineage, sample, file1, file2, refgenome (filename of fasta)

6. `get-reference-no-mito.sh` -- Remove mitochondrial chromosome from reference genome (`VNBI.fasta`).

7. `Snakefile-references.smk` -- is a Snakefile to lift over annotations from `FungiDB-53_CneoformansH99_PMM.gff` into the four lineage genomes (`{lineage}_{GenBank Accession}.fasta`).  
    * It currently works with:  
  ` snakemake --snakefile Snakefile-references.smk --cores 1 --use-conda --conda-frontend conda -p`:  
      ⚠️ `--cores 1` is because there is a problem if Liftoff runs in parallel because the different jobs try to create `FungiDB-65_CneoformansH99.gff_db` at the same time and that is not cool.    
      ⚠️ `--conda-frontend conda` because it cannot use mamba, which is the default.  
      AGAT makes `{lineage}_liftoff.agat.log` files by default, we would need to edit the 'agat_config.yaml' to change that.  
      ⏰ Pending: Merge into main workflow.
    * Files produced:  
  
      * `reference_genomes/{lineage}_liftoff.gff_polished`
      * `reference_genomes/{lineage}_predicted_proteins.fa`
      * `reference_genomes/{lineage}_predicted_cds.fa`
      * `protein_list.txt`
      * And more intermediate and extra files

8. `Snakefile-main.smk`-- is the Snakefile to run the pipeline, it uses the `config.yaml` file.  
It runs the script `scripts/fastq-combiner.xsh` for each sample in `read_pair_table.csv`. This concatenates all `_1.fastq` of one sample into only one file named `{SRS-accession}_1.fq.gz` and compresses it and does the same for `_2.fastq`.  This files are in `fastq_combined/`.
It runs **snippy**, **liftoff** and **agat** for each sample, it **extracts sequences** (cds and protein) of each sample and **concatenates** them by cds and by protein.

    * Files produced:  
    
      * `fastq_combined/{SRS-accession}_1.fq.gz` and `fastq_combined/{SRS-accession}_2.fq.gz`.
      * `genomes-annotations/{sample}/snps.consensus.fa` and extra assembly files    
      * `genomes-annotations/{sample}/snps.bam` and extra alignment files  
      * `genomes-annotations/{sample}/snps.vcf` and extra variant calling files  
      * `genomes-annotations/{sample}/lifted.gff_polished` and extra annotation files  
      * `genomes-annotations/{sample}/predicted_cds.fa`  and extra index files
      * `genomes-annotations/{sample}/predicted_proteins.fa`  and extra index files
      * `genomes-annotations/{sample}/predicted_proteins.fa`  
      * `by_cds/{protein}.fa` (and the non-concatenated sequences are in `cds/{sample}_{protein}.fa`)
      * `by_protein/{protein}.fa` (and the non-concatenated sequences are in `proteins/{sample}_{protein}.fa`)

9. `Snakefile-depth-quality.smk`: Generates **quality and coverage** plots.  
   * Files produced:  
  
     * In progress...
