# WeavePop_Cneoformans

Description of running the [WeavePop](https://github.com/magwenelab/WeavePop) in the Desjardins et al. 2017 and Ashton et al. 2019 datasets and the analyses of the results.

## Download and processing of data and config files

### References

The reference genome assemblies for each lineage are:
 * VNI: Strain H99 from [FungiDB release 65](https://fungidb.org/common/downloads/release-65/CneoformansH99/).  
 * VNII: Strain VNII from [GCA_022832995.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_022832995.1/).  
 * VNBI: Strain Bt22, genome assembled by Marco A. Coelho [PRJNA1081442](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA1081442).  
 * VNBII: Strain Bt89 from [GCA_023650575.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_023650575.1/).

Align the other reference genomes to the VNI reference genome to obtain assemblies that have the same orientation
and know the homology between chromosomes as described in [cryptococcus_reference_genomes](https://github.com/magwenelab/cryptococcus_reference_genomes). Create the `config/chromosomes.csv` files in both `Crypto_Desjardins/` and `Crypto_Ashton/` from the results of that pipeline.

The script `scripts/remove_chromosome.sh` was used to remove the mitochondrial chromosome of the `VNI.fasta` genome. 

### FASTQs

The raw Illumina sequencing reads were downloaded from the NIH Sequence Read Archive (BioProject IDs Desjardins: PRJNA382844; Ashton: PRJEB27222 and PRJEB5282) using the workflow [download-tools](https://github.com/magwenelab/download-tools). In the cases where there were multiple sequencing runs for a given BioSample, we concatenated the FASTQ files of all the paired runs into one. This creates the FASTQ files and the tables `config/reads_table.csv` -- Columns are `sample` (SRS ID), `run` (SRR ID), `file1` (read pair 1), `file2` (read pair 2), `file_unpaired` (unpaired reads). The unpaired reads were ignored.

The reads were cleaned with FastP using the script `scripts/fastp_clean.sh` (executed with `scripts/run_fastp_clean.sh`.)

### Metadata
The metadata was formatted with the scripts `scripts/prepare_desjardins_metadata.xsh` and `scripts/prepare_metadata_ashton.ipynb`. It adds the sample ID (SRS accession) to the original metadata tables and standardize the format. They use `config/Desjardins_Supplemental_Table_S1.csv` and `config/Ashton_Supplemental_Table_S1.csv`, and `config/reads_table.csv` files in both `Crypto_Desjardins/` and `Crypto_Ashton/`. It was run with the environment `misc/sra-tools.yaml`. It creates the tables `config/metadata.csv` in both `Crypto_Desjardins/` and `Crypto_Ashton/`. 

### Loci table
A table with genes of interest to add to the plots was created with the following information: The gene IDs of the centromere adjacent genes were takem from Janbon 2014. MAT loci protein_coding_gene IDs (everything between SXI1 and STE12) were taken from the VNI genome GFF. The rRNA genes (with the tags level1 ncRNA and level2 rRNA) from the VNI annotation.    
  * `config/loci.csv`

### RepBase
The RepBase database of consensus repetitive sequences was downloaded with the following steps to create: 
  * `config/RepBase.fasta`  
```
wget https://www.girinst.org/server/RepBase/protected/RepBase29.01.fasta.tar.gz
tar -xvzf RepBase29.01.fasta.tar.gz
cat RepBase29.01.fasta/*.ref > RepBase.fasta
cat RepBase29.01.fasta/appendix/*.ref >> RepBase.fasta
rm -rf RepBase29.01.fasta/ RepBase29.01.fasta.tar.gz 
```

## Workflow execution

1) Run the analysis workflow for each dataset:
```
conda activate snakemake
snakemake --profile Crypto_Desjardins/config/default
snakemake --profile Crypto_Ashton/config/default
``` 
See log files:  
  `Crypto_Desjardins/logs/weavepop_all.log`  
  `Crypto_Ashton/logs/weavepop_all.log`  

2) Run the join datasets workflow:

```
snakemake --profile Crypto_Desjardins_Ashton/config/default
```
See log file:  
`Crypto_Desjardins_Ashton/logs/weavepop_all.log`  

3) Rerun the workflow exluding non-haploid (based on the `explore_depth.qmd` analysis described below)
 and low quality samples. 

See log files:  
  `Crypto_Desjardins/logs/weavepop_exclude.log`  
  `Crypto_Ashton/logs/weavepop_exclude.log`  

4) Rerun the join datasets workflow.  

See log file:  
`Crypto_Desjardins_Ashton/logs/weavepop_exclude.log`  


## Analyses

```
analyses/
├── data # Raw data and data processed by the scripts here
├── misc # `quarto.yaml` environment definition
├── notebooks # Rendered versions of Quarto documents
├── results # Results of the analyses
├── scripts # Scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and Quarto documents
```

The working directory of all the Quarto documents is `analyses/`.  
They are rendered with the command: `quarto render analyses/scripts/<name>.qmd`.  

The script `analyses/scripts/metadata_colors.R` creates color palettes for the metadata to use in the plots.

All the input files used in the analyses come from the input or results of WeavePop in `Crypto_Desjardins`, `Crypto_Ashton` or `Crypto_Desjardins_Ashton` or from the following external data.  

External data:  
* `data/raw/CryptoDiversity_Desjardins_Tree.tre`: From [CryptoDiversity_Tree_Info](https://github.com/magwenelab/CryptoDiversity_Tree_Info/blob/main/CryptoDiversity_Desjardins_Tree.tre)
* `data/raw/2017.06.09.all_ours_and_desj.snp_sites.mod.fa.cln.tree`: Sent by Philip Ashton (Dec 5 2024).
